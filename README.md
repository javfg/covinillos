<p align="center">Using D3.js charts</p>

This is just a set of charts made with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to teach
myself how to use the library. You can check out a live version
[here](https://covid.meneillos.com).

It uses data from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins
University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
